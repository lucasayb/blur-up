# Blur Up


This is an example of the Blur Up implementation.

Here is the explanation of how it works

> "The (ingenious) solution was to return a tiny image (around 40 pixels wide) and then scale that tiny image up whilst applying a gaussian blur. This instantly shows a background that looks aesthetically pleasing, and gives a preview of how the cover image would look. The actual cover image could then be loaded in the background in good time, and smoothly switched in. Smart thinking!" - [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/the-blur-up-technique-for-loading-background-images/)
